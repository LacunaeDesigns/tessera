# Progress — execution tracker

The living record of what is actually done, against [roadmap.md](roadmap.md). Update when a task lands; `/release` refuses if this file lies. The cross-machine twin is the Ariadne vault (`projects/tessera.md`) — status there, granularity here.

**Snapshot (2026-07-12):** **v0.6.0 — occasions, deck mode, the letter ladder, and draft autosave (partial v0.3 + a UI pass + a lost-work fix).** The start of v0.3 Occasions & Series plus polish and one real bug fix. **Occasion library** grew 10→16 sets (graduation, open-when-heartbroken, marrying-my-child, retirement, last-day, next-owner; house voice, via /occasion). **Deck mode:** occasions may carry a `deck` of interview questions (milestone-18 has the first); "Answer a few questions instead" runs a one-question-per-screen interview that stitches into the letter with a "make them yours" soft note, plus an opt-in "keep the raw answers" → `media/interview.txt` keepsake (media/ is spec-legal; `export.js` sets `f.media` and manifest/README already emit it conditionally — **no format change**). **The letter ladder:** an inline-SVG timeline of waiting letters atop the shelf (sqrt time axis, decade word-ticks, group-tinted rings, prints with the register). **Compact ledger dates** ("12 Jul 2036") in the register table + wallet card, while the cover/flap/opening keep the full spelled-out words. A **UI/UX pass** (via ui-ux-pro-max): the desk's secondary actions became quiet pill-buttons, then a readability fix (word-count 2.5→3.7:1, "change recipient" 3.7→5.6:1, card "opens" date 2.9→5.0:1, bigger tap targets). **Draft autosave:** the desk now debounce-saves and restores the in-progress letter (the landing.js rebuild had silently dropped the old room's autosave — a lost-work regression); it **never persists the passphrase** and never resurrects a sealed draft. **No format change:** spec stays 0.1, manifest/zip/token fixtures byte-identical, so the century surface is unchanged from the physically-verified v0.5.0. Triple at 0.6.0 / `'0.6.0'` / `'tessera-v0.6.0'`. Gates: Gate 1 (7 suites green throughout incl. crypt), Gate 2 (prose baseline; justified WARNs are pre-existing code-comment em-dashes + the `'—'` UI glyph, no new letter copy carries em-dashes), Gate 3 (browser-verified each feature: ladder render/one-page-fit/375px, deck interview→stitch + soft note, compact dates, pill readability with real contrast math, autosave restore + passphrase-absent-from-storage + no-resurrection on true reload, media/interview.txt written with manifest entry + README line + checksums, zero console errors), Gate 4 (the letter-kit physical walkthrough carries over from v0.5.0 — no letter-folder/format change; the new print-surface changes, compact ledger dates and the register ladder, are presentation within the print rules and verified in print-preview, with a register reprint as a light inherited check), Gate 5 (`/spec-sync` clean — only export.js moved among format files and fixtures stayed byte-identical, so no drift; docs scan clean; decisions recorded). **Since v0.6.0, on `dev` (unreleased):** the **milestone series wizard (Task 3) is built** — a whole ladder of letters in one sitting (child-years 5/10/15/18 with per-rung prompts; the `anniversary` occasion gains a shared-prompt ladder 1/5/10/15/20/25). Shared to/from/custody + one anchor date; each rung's open date computed from year-offsets (editable, removable); N per-rung letters with a running sidebar; sealing loops the one seal path per rung → N self-contained zips + N registry rows + one print job (`TesseraPrint.printKits`). Data + UI + presentation only — **no format change** (no manifest/token/zip/fixture diff; occasions are data, `occasion` is already a free manifest string), verified in-browser (3-letter fixture ⇒ 3 valid folders, 3 registry rows, one print job with per-letter footers; 375px no overflow; zero console errors). Also since v0.6.0 on `dev`: **co-written letters (Task 5, format + compose)** — the author OK'd the `writers[]` shape, so the manifest gains an **optional `writers[]`** (additive, `from` stays the single seed-bearing string, spec 0.1, fixtures byte-identical), and the seal step gained a "We are writing this together" second-writer field (combined `from` + `writers[]`) plus writing-bar "turn" buttons for the alternating voice (merged is the default). Browser-verified. The **co-written token** (Task 5 Step 3) then landed as **Option B** (author's call): two identical keeper halves + one traveller, a `print.js` print-kit change (`token.js`/seed/fixtures untouched) — so **Task 5 is complete**. Also since v0.6.0: the **bound-booklet export (Tasks 1–3) is complete** on `dev`. Imposition math (`js/booklet.js`, fixture-tested), the composer (select/order kept letters → logical page model + preview, plus write-back interleaving — a detected correspondence retitles to "The correspondence, whole" and reorders by written date, requiring a real registry schema bump, 3→4, for the new `inReplyTo` field), and the imposed printable render (`printBooklet()` in `print.js`: sequential cut-and-staple + signature fold-and-sew duplex modes, both using the fixture-tested `impose()` math, a mode picker in the composer, page-position footers on every leaf) all landed. A QA pass caught and fixed a real bug found while working out US-Letter tolerance: the booklet's sheet/leaf geometry was sized to the full nominal A4 page rather than the `@page` margin-reduced content area, overflowing on every print job (A4 included, not just Letter) — now margin-aware on both axes and tolerant of A4/Letter alike. Author physically printed and folded a signature-mode copy (page order confirmed correct) before the geometry fix; a re-check on the corrected geometry is recommended, not required. **Remaining v0.3:** the **webfont** decision (author print-evidence gate) and the **grief set** (Task 6 — outside reader). Previous: **v0.5.0 — the envelope & print themes.** The print kit gains a fold-and-glue envelope sheet and four print themes. The envelope is genuinely no-cut: fold the sheet in thirds, glue the two overlapping side edges, and the tri-folded letter slots in — taught three ways on one page (labelled fold ▽/△, "glue this side", and "trim, optional" marks on the template; a four-step hairline fold diagram with per-step instructions; and an exploded kit-assembly diagram showing letter-inside / cover-outside / token-half), all ink-light hairline and fitting A4 and Letter with headroom even under the browser's header/footer chrome (~198mm Letter, stress-tested with a long recipient + year-2126 date). Offered via a print-toolbar checkbox, default on for dated letters, off for open-when letters. Four themes — letterpress (default, current look), aerogramme (airmail red/blue edging, "Par avion" kicker), telegram (monospace date-stamped cover header, doubled hairline rules, body stays serif), wax-seal (dashed placement circle holding the letter's own token disk at 20mm, "seal here, if you have wax") — chosen in the print toolbar and persisted to `settings.printTheme` (new `getSetting`/`setSetting` on state.js; `settings` already exists at schema 3, no migrate change). Themes restyle only the cover, envelope, letter and token sheets; the instructions sheet is never theme-scoped and is byte-identical across all four (verified). **Print-time presentation only — no format change:** spec stays 0.1, the token seed is untouched, manifest/zip/token fixtures are byte-identical, so the century-critical surface is unchanged from the physically-verified v0.4.1. Triple at 0.5.0 / `'0.5.0'` / `'tessera-v0.5.0'`. Gates: Gate 1 (7 suites green incl. crypt), Gate 2 (prose baseline — 8 justified WARNs, all pre-existing code comments plus the `'—'` UI-placeholder glyph; the new letter-facing copy carries no em-dashes), Gate 3 (browser sweep of all four themes: correct sheet set, envelope defaults off for undated letters, instructions byte-identical across themes, envelope one-page fit verified under print-media emulation incl. a long-recipient/year-2126 stress case, zero console errors), Gate 4 (author physical walkthrough — printed and folded the envelope; the fold-thirds + glue-the-two-sides model confirmed working, letter slots in), Gate 5 (`/spec-sync` clean — no format surface touched; docs TBD scan clean; decisions recorded in decisions.md). Found and fixed en route: the wax-seal cover ornament guarding a token with no `.full` disk (the opening-flow print path), and the envelope's original glue-tab design that contradicted "No cutting required" (corrected to genuine edge-gluing, author's call over embracing scissors). Previous: **v0.4.1 — nav readability, mobile icons, open-source link.** Landing-only polish: the nav links (washed out on the watercolor since the "one wash" redesign) go to 0.85 ink on a translucent glass strip (panel `backdrop-filter` language, opaque fallback); on mobile (≤700px) each link becomes a hand-drawn inline-SVG icon + short label (Write/Open/Letters/About, no webfont); and a "Source on GitHub" link now appears in the footer plus a durability-framed line in a new About "Yours to keep" section. CSS/HTML only — no JS, no format change (spec stays 0.1, fixtures untouched), so the century-critical surface is byte-identical to v0.4.0 and Gate 4's physical walkthrough carries over. Triple at 0.4.1 / `'0.4.1'` / `'tessera-v0.4.1'` (the bump is what invalidates the SW cache so clients actually receive the new CSS). Gates: Gate 1 (7 suites green, fixtures intact), Gate 2 (prose baseline; new About/footer copy carries no em-dashes), Gate 3 (browser walkthrough desktop + 375px: links readable on the glass, four icons+labels on one row with no overflow, both GitHub links resolve, no console errors), Gate 4 (inherited — no format/print/letter change from the physically-verified v0.4.0), Gate 5 (docs placeholder scan clean, no format change so spec-sync n-a). Previous: **v0.4.0 — passphrase privacy.** Optional AES-256-GCM encryption at seal time (PBKDF2-SHA256 key, per-seal random salt/IV; `js/crypt.js`), an optional additive manifest `encryption` field (format stays 0.1 — the version string is baked into the token seed, so it is never bumped), `letter.txt.enc` in place of `letter.txt` while `README.txt` stays plaintext always, a printed key-escrow card (`print.js`), the honesty page (`#honesty`), and a passphrase prompt on opening (`landing/opening.js`). The passphrase is never persisted (verified: absent from every folder byte). Also folded in since v0.3.3: the landing greeting input-race fix and the commons moderation policy. Triple at 0.4.0 / `'0.4.0'` / `'tessera-v0.4.0'`. All gates green this session — Gate 1 (7 suites incl. `test-crypt`, fixtures byte-identical), Gate 2 (prose baseline), Gate 3 (375px browser walkthrough: normal seal loop + reload persist + print kit + offline SW incl `crypt.js` + full encrypted seal→open→decrypt, no console errors), Gate 4 (author physical walkthrough on an encrypted letter, confirmed), Gate 5 (`/spec-sync` clean, docs placeholder scan clean, decisions recorded). Previous: **v0.3.3 shipped — one wash, glass sections.** The landing's hero watercolor is the page's only background (fixed `body::before` layer, iOS-safe); every section scrolls over it as a translucent liquid-glass panel (`backdrop-filter: blur(8px)`, more-opaque `@supports` fallback). Per-section art and `sec-fade` seams unreferenced; hero art variants keyed to viewport aspect ratio; `min(…,100%)` grid guards protect 375px. CSS/HTML only — no format change (spec stays 0.1, fixtures untouched). Triple at 0.3.3 / `'0.3.3'` / `'tessera-v0.3.3'`. All gates re-run in-session (six suites, prose, Playwright browser walkthrough with a real three-letter seal loop + A4/Letter print kit PDFs + offline + reduced-motion, century audit all rows evidenced, spec-sync clean). Previous: **v0.3.2 — the sealed-receipt overflow fix.** The mid-session 375px horizontal overflow (scrollWidth 444 after write → seal → open-overlay) is fixed: the sealed receipt's token SVG now sizes to its container instead of laying out at its raw 400px. One CSS rule, no format change. Previous: **v0.3.1 — the watercolor mosaic token.** The token disk's art is reborn as generation 2 (seeded pastel washes under a finer per-letter mosaic); generation 1 is frozen forever in `js/token-legacy.js` and `verifyLetter` falls back to it, so every previously sealed letter still verifies clean with no warning. No format change (fixtures byte-identical for the untouched files; old token fixtures renamed, never regenerated; new ones born). Triple at 0.3.1 / `'0.3.1'` / `'tessera-v0.3.1'`; `main` fast-forwarded from `dev`. All gates re-run this session (six suites incl. both-generation token tests, prose, full browser walkthrough, spec-sync clean), century-audit rows evidenced with a real physical walkthrough (printed, cut, matched by eye — not waived). Remaining v0.2 plans: encryption, then envelope-themes.

## Log (newest first)

- **2026-07-12 (v0.3 Task 5 Step 3 — co-written token: Option B, on `dev`)** — The open token
  question resolved on rendered evidence (author's call): **two identical keeper halves, one per
  writer, plus the traveller** — not a three-way break. The token authenticates by pattern-matching by
  eye (SPEC §5), so identical keeper prints both meet the single traveller along the same seeded edge;
  B is the sturdier physical object (no three-cut convergence at the centre) and needs no new art.
  **Not a fixture/format event:** `token.js`, the seed, IDs, and every token fixture are untouched
  (test-token unchanged) — it is a `print.js` `tokenSheet` branch that fires when
  `sealed.fields.writers.length >= 2`, rendering the keeper half (`s.token.left`) twice, labelled per
  writer, beside the traveller (`s.token.right`). Writer names are XML-escaped before entering the SVG
  (they are user text — caught by the security-guidance hook). Verified in-browser: the trio sheet
  shows the right labels, a name containing `<` renders escaped (no injection), and single-author
  letters still use the normal two-half sheet. This completes Task 5. decisions.md records it.
  Also landed this session: booklet `impose()` math (`ba40a6e`) and the booklet composer (`0fc89fb`).

- **2026-07-12 (v0.3 Task 5 — co-written letters: format + compose, on `dev`, unreleased)** — A
  **format event** (author-approved shape): the manifest gains an optional `writers[]` array while `from`
  stays the single human string that feeds the token seed (SPEC §5), so IDs and every existing fixture are
  unchanged and the spec stays `0.1` — the same additive-optional protocol as `encryption`/`media`.
  `buildManifest` emits `writers` right after `to` only when present; `export.js` plumbs it through the one
  seal path; `test-manifest` asserts the seed ignores `writers`, `from` stays a string, version stays 0.1,
  and the field is omitted when absent. SPEC §3 + `docs/spec/manifest-schema.md` document it; decisions.md
  records it. Compose (Step 2): the **seal step** (where `from` is entered — the coherent home for
  authorship, a refinement over the old plan's "setup overlay" text) gained *"We are writing this
  together"* → a second-writer field; both names combine into `from` = "A and B" + `writers[]`, and the
  writing bar offers each writer's labelled *turn* to drop into the letter (the alternating voice; merged
  is the default, per the author). Gates: node --check + all 6 suites green; **fixtures byte-identical**
  (no seed change, no new fixture yet); browser-verified via real DOM events — co-written seal ⇒ manifest
  `from:"Maria and Tomas"`, `writers:["Maria","Tomas"]` (positioned after `to`), ID derived from the
  combined seed, registry carries the combined name; turn buttons insert labelled turns; **single-writer
  regression clean (no `writers` key)**; 375px zero overflow; zero console errors. (The stale-SW cache trap
  struck again — port 8137 carried another session's service worker serving old HTML; unregistered +
  caches cleared + hard reload, per [[sw-cache-first-preview-trap]].) **Deferred, remaining Task 5:** the
  **three-way token break** for two keeper halves (Step 3) — a `/token-lab` decision on rendered visual
  evidence, a fixture birth for the new path; co-written letters authenticate on the existing two-half
  token until then. `main` promotion + version bump are the author's gated `/release` step.

- **2026-07-12 (v0.3 Task 3 — the milestone series wizard, on `dev`, unreleased)** — A whole ladder
  of letters in one sitting. Data: an optional `series: { label, anchor, rungs:[{years,title,prompts?}] }`
  on an occasion; a new `child-years` occasion carries per-rung prompts at ages 5/10/15/18, and the
  existing `anniversary` occasion gains a shared-prompt ladder [1,5,10,15,20,25] (rungs omit prompts and
  fall back to the occasion set). Rung dates are **year-offsets from an anchor date**, never baked (the
  data file stays deterministic); the spec's literal "every anniversary to 25" is defaulted to the
  milestone years, editable/removable in the wizard (flagged in decisions.md). UI: the occasion step
  offers "Write the whole ladder in one sitting"; the wizard (`#series-overlay`, reusing the setup-overlay
  pattern) collects shared to/from/custody + one anchor, prefills each rung's date, walks N per-rung
  letter screens with a running sidebar, then a review→seal screen. Seal loops the **one seal path**
  (`TesseraExport.seal`) per rung in date order → N self-contained `tessera-<ID>.zip` downloads (the
  N-separate-zips decision), N `role:'writer'` registry rows, and one print job via a new
  `TesseraPrint.printKits(sealedList)` (concatenates each letter's `kitSheets`; presentation-only).
  Progress persists to a `'series'` draft slot (never the passphrase; **no `migrate()` bump** — the
  de-stale note supersedes the plan's `draft.series[]` step) and reopens on reload. **No format change:**
  manifest/export/token/zip and all fixtures byte-identical; `occasion` is already a free manifest string.
  Gates: Gate 1 — `node --check` on occasions/print/landing clean, 6 suites green; Gate 2 — prose-check
  baseline (only the pre-existing header-comment em-dash; the new prompts carry none); Gate 3 — full
  in-browser walkthrough (offer appears for series occasions; anchor 2024-03-01 → rungs 2029/2034/2039/2042;
  trim to a 3-letter fixture; write all three; **seal ⇒ 3 distinct IDs, 3 downloads, 3 registry rows in
  date order, done screen "3 letters, sealed."; print-all ⇒ 15 sheets = 3 kits with per-letter cover
  footers correct**; 375px no horizontal overflow on any screen; zero console errors — driven via real
  DOM events, as the pane's screenshot/read_page pipeline stalled on the animated hero, a known
  environment quirk); Gate 5 — no format-file diff since main, so `/spec-sync` is clean. decisions.md
  records the series shape, scope, and the anniversary-default deviation. `main` promotion and a version
  bump are the author's gated `/release` step.

- **2026-07-11 (v0.4.1 — nav readability, mobile icons, open-source link)** — Released via `/release`.
  Patch bump 0.4.0 → 0.4.1; triple together: `version.json` 0.4.1 · `LOCAL_VERSION` `'0.4.1'` ·
  `CACHE_VERSION` `'tessera-v0.4.1'` (the CACHE_VERSION bump is required for the new CSS to reach
  clients past the cache-first SW). Landing-only, no JS, no format change. What shipped (PR #4):
  nav links 0.6 → 0.85 ink on a translucent glass strip (same panel `backdrop-filter` language, opaque
  fallback) — fixes the washed-out links the "one wash" redesign left on the watercolor; a mobile
  (≤700px) icon nav (hand-drawn inline SVGs, `stroke=currentColor`, no webfont, with short labels);
  and a GitHub source link in the footer + a durability-framed line in a new About "Yours to keep"
  section (clone/run from a folder forever, tied to the century test). Gates this session: Gate 1 —
  7 suites PASS, token fixtures byte-identical; Gate 2 — prose baseline (new About/footer copy has no
  em-dashes); Gate 3 — browser walkthrough desktop (1280) + 375px: links readable on the glass strip
  (nav computes `rgba(255,253,246,0.62)` + blur after a source-order fix caught in QA), four
  icons+labels on one row with no horizontal overflow, both GitHub links resolve with
  `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, no console errors; Gate 4 — inherited (the format/print/letter surface
  is byte-identical to the physically-verified v0.4.0); Gate 5 — docs placeholder scan clean, no format
  change so spec-sync is n-a. decisions.md records the `@supports` source-order gotcha.
  `main` promotion is the author's gated step.

- **2026-07-11 (v0.4.0 — passphrase privacy)** — Released via `/release`. Minor bump (new feature)
  0.3.3 → 0.4.0; triple moved together: `version.json` 0.4.0 · `LOCAL_VERSION` `'0.4.0'` ·
  `CACHE_VERSION` `'tessera-v0.4.0'`. What shipped: optional passphrase encryption (SPEC §9) —
  AES-256-GCM with a PBKDF2-SHA256 key and per-seal random salt/IV (`js/crypt.js`); an additive
  optional manifest `encryption` field (format deliberately stays 0.1, since the version string is
  baked into the token seed and a bump would rewrite every existing letter — decisions.md 2026-07-11);
  `letter.txt.enc` replacing `letter.txt` when locked, `README.txt` never encrypted; a printed
  key-escrow card; the `/about#honesty` encryption section; and a passphrase prompt in the opening
  flow. The passphrase is never persisted. Also carried since v0.3.3: the landing greeting input-race
  fix (PR #1) and the commons moderation policy (PR #2). Gates, all re-run this session with evidence:
  Gate 1 — 7 suites PASS (incl. new `test-crypt`, extended `test-manifest`/`test-open`), token fixtures
  byte-identical, `/spec-sync` clean; Gate 2 — prose-check at baseline (10 WARNs, all em-dashes in
  comments or the recorded placeholder glyphs, no letter-facing copy regressed); Gate 3 — 375px-first
  browser walkthrough (real WebCrypto): normal compose→seal→zip→registry→reload-persist, print kit
  renders 4 sheets with footers, offline SW cache holds CORE incl. `crypt.js`, and the full encrypted
  path (seal → `letter.txt.enc` with README plaintext and the passphrase absent from every folder byte
  → verify defers the token cleanly → wrong-passphrase retry → right-passphrase decrypt), zero console
  errors, no horizontal overflow at 375 (light or dark; the landing is paper-themed, unchanged by this
  release); Gate 4 — author's physical walkthrough on an encrypted letter, confirmed working as intended;
  Gate 5 — `/spec-sync` clean, docs placeholder scan clean (the gate's own wording was fixed so it no
  longer trips its own grep), decisions recorded. `main` promotion is the author's gated step.

- **2026-07-11 (v0.2 passphrase privacy — in review, unreleased)** — On `feat/v0.2-encryption`
  (off `dev`), five commits: `js/crypt.js` AES-256-GCM + PBKDF2-SHA256 wrapper (fixture-tested,
  the one module exempt from the no-randomness rule); optional `encryption` manifest field +
  `open.js` encrypted-letter handling (detects `letter.txt.enc`, defers the plaintext-derived token
  check, no false warnings); the format event (SPEC §9, schema doc, decisions.md — additive, format
  stays 0.1 because the version string is baked into the token seed; `/spec-sync` clean); and the
  UI/seal/print/honesty/open wiring. Two isolated files (`print.js` escrow card, `opening.js` decrypt
  prompt) built by parallel subagents, reviewed and integrated. Browser QA (real WebCrypto, desktop +
  375px): encrypted seal writes `letter.txt.enc` with README plaintext and the passphrase absent from
  every folder byte; verify defers the token cleanly; wrong passphrase gives a clear retry; right
  passphrase decrypts; unencrypted control still writes `letter.txt`; escrow card renders; full open
  flow (date gate → passphrase → retry → unlock → read) works; no console errors; no 375px overflow.
  All 7 Gate-1 suites + prose green. Not merged; awaiting review/release.

- **2026-07-11 (v0.3.3 — one wash, glass sections)** — Released via `/release`. Version: patch bump
  to 0.3.3 (a landing restyle; no JS behavior change, no format change — `/spec-sync` confirms zero
  lines changed across every format-critical file since v0.3.2). Triple moved together:
  `version.json` 0.3.3 · `LOCAL_VERSION` `'0.3.3'` · `CACHE_VERSION` `'tessera-v0.3.3'`. What
  shipped: the wash-and-glass redesign recorded in the log entry below (fixed hero watercolor as
  the page's only background; sections as translucent liquid-glass panels). Gates, all re-run this
  session with evidence: Gate 1 (no JS touched by the restyle; six suites PASS; zero fixture
  diffs), Gate 2 (prose-check: 9 WARNs, all em-dashes in code comments or the two recorded
  placeholder glyphs — no letter-facing copy changed), Gate 3 via Playwright Chromium (the in-app
  pane's screenshot capture stalls on the animated hero — pre-existing, reproduced on the v0.3.2
  checkout): 375px-first walkthrough with a real seal loop — three letters sealed through
  export.js (TSR-2403-32a8 with custody, TSR-d92c-072c, TSR-891f-436a), zip verified (store
  method bytes `00 00`, no BOM, SHA-256 of letter.txt independently recomputed and matched
  checksums.txt), registry rows + reload persistence, print kit rendered as real A4 + Letter PDFs
  (cover assembly line, letter sheet, instructions, token cut sheet, footers on every page),
  wallet card PDF, offline reload served whole from `tessera-v0.3.2` SW cache (40 entries),
  reduced-motion leaves no reveal armed, zero console errors, scrollWidth never exceeded the
  viewport at 375 or 1280. Century audit: all rows ✓ or n-a with evidence (0 external requests
  from localhost AND `file://`; app fully renders from `file://`; token.svg's only "http" is the
  xmlns namespace identifier; custody prose confirmed in README). Physical walkthrough: no
  format or print-surface change since the v0.3.1 physical pass (author printed, cut, matched) —
  that result stands, per the v0.3.2 precedent. Found en route, pre-existing and out of scope
  (flagged as a follow-up task): hardware-keyboard input during the greeting autotype interleaves
  text into the letter (`onTaInput` lacks the guard `typeChar` has).

- **2026-07-11 (one wash, glass sections — on dev, committed f1f29dc)** — The landing's hero watercolor
  is now the page's only background: a fixed full-viewport layer (`body::before`, iOS-safe) that
  every section scrolls over, each section's inner wrapper a translucent warm-white liquid-glass
  panel (`backdrop-filter: blur(8px)`, with a more opaque `@supports` fallback so readability
  never depends on the effect). The per-section art (`bg-seal`/`bg-token`/`bg-letters`) and the
  `sec-fade` gradient seams are unreferenced; hero art variants now select by viewport
  aspect-ratio instead of width; the seal and token grids gained `min(…, 100%)` column guards so
  panel padding can't reintroduce a 375px overflow. CSS + HTML only — no JS, no format change.
  Verified: six suites green; browser pass at 375px (hero, seal, how, about, token, letters,
  footer, plus the writing phase — scrollWidth never exceeded the viewport) and 1280px (16:9
  wash variant confirmed); zero console errors. QA note: the in-app pane's screenshot capture
  kept timing out on the animated hero (pre-existing — reproduced on the pre-change checkout via
  stash), so the visual pass ran through Playwright's own Chromium instead. decisions.md entry
  same day.

- **2026-07-11 (v0.3.1 — token generation 2, the watercolor mosaic)** — Released via `/release`.
  Version: patch bump to 0.3.1 (an art change within the token family; no format-breaking change —
  the manifest `tessera` spec version stays 0.1, `/spec-sync` confirms zero lines changed across
  every format-critical file). Triple moved together: `version.json` 0.3.1 · `LOCAL_VERSION`
  `'0.3.1'` · `CACHE_VERSION` `'tessera-v0.3.1'`. What shipped: the token disk is reborn as the
  **watercolor mosaic** (author-selected A2 from three rendered candidates): seeded pastel washes
  pooling beneath a finer per-letter ring mosaic (4–5 seeded rings, ~175–208 tiles, per-ring
  phase), ink-dark skeleton preserved for grayscale/fading; the break line and its interlocking
  notches are byte-identical to generation 1 — the authentication mechanism is untouched. Format
  event handled loudly: generation 1 frozen forever in `js/token-legacy.js`, original fixture
  bytes renamed (never regenerated) to `token-legacy-fix*.svg` and asserted against the frozen
  renderer, gen-2 fixtures born; `verifyLetter` falls back to the legacy renderer so every
  previously sealed letter verifies clean with no warning (proven in test-open: a gen-1-sealed
  folder returns tokenOk with zero token warnings, and the re-drawn art shown is the matching
  generation). Ship: `main` fast-forwarded from `dev`, pushed; Netlify deploys `main` (unlisted).
  Author approved the ship.

  Gates re-run this session, all green: Gate 1 — syntax sweep silent, six suites green (test-token
  walks both generations, 51 asserts), fixtures byte-identical (`git status --porcelain
  tools/fixtures/` empty). Gate 2 — prose clean but for the same nine justified WARNs as v0.3.0
  (code-comment em-dashes + the documented placeholder glyphs; no new letter-facing copy). Gate 3
  — full browser pass: seal shows gen-2 art on the receipt (209 tiles, wash fill-opacity present)
  and the print kit; a freshly sealed letter verifies clean via the current renderer ("They
  match.", no warnings); a letter built with the frozen legacy renderer verifies clean via the
  fallback (no "enclosed token" warning; the re-drawn figure is provably the legacy art — zero
  wash fill-opacity, ~64-tile count) and still opens and reads correctly; zero console errors; no
  external requests; 375px clean. Token-lab visual pass: fixture seeds + four exploratory seeds
  rendered at full/faded/drawer-distance on the companion — wash-core stacking caps at ~0.79 alpha
  of a light pastel (cannot go opaque-dark), break-stroke contrast bottoms at ~1.8:1 over gold
  pastel (same order as gen 1 over its warm mids, ~8:1 over ink). `/spec-sync` clean: zero lines
  changed across every format-critical file (manifest.js, zip.js, export.js, SPEC.md, spec docs)
  in all seven token commits.

  Century audit (letter-level rows carry from v0.3.0 — no format change; the token row is
  re-evidenced for both generations this session; **physical walkthrough done, not waived**: the
  author printed a real generation-2 sheet, cut it, and matched the halves by eye — decisions.md):

  | Row | Verdict | Evidence |
  |---|---|---|
  | A: no required URL · file:// + no external requests · fork = identical tool · data only on device | ✓ | unchanged since v0.3.0; token art carries no network dependency in either generation |
  | B: UTF-8 no BOM · zip store · manifest ⊂ README · dates ISO+words | ✓ | six suites green, fixtures byte-identical; manifest/zip/export untouched |
  | B: token.svg plain, no scripts/refs/fonts/filters — **both generations** | ✓ | node check: gen 2 and legacy both `noScript/noFilter/noExternal/genericFontsOnly = true` |
  | B: media guidance | n-a | no media |
  | C: spec CC0 · tool MIT · format outlives project · decisions recorded | ✓ | unchanged; decisions.md holds the format-event entry + the physical-check record |
  | D: paper completeness · cold-read · checksums · assembly | ✓ | kit structure unchanged; only the token's tile art changed |
  | D: token authenticates by eye | ✓ (done, not waived) | author printed a gen-2 sheet, cut along the dashed line, halves matched by eye |

- **2026-07-11 (v0.3.2 — sealed-receipt overflow fix)** — Released via `/release`. Version: patch
  bump to 0.3.2 (a layout fix, no format change). Triple: `version.json` 0.3.2 · `LOCAL_VERSION`
  `'0.3.2'` · `CACHE_VERSION` `'tessera-v0.3.2'`. The browser-QA layout quirk (scrollWidth 444
  at a 375px viewport after write → seal → open-overlay, no reload) is fixed. Root cause was not the
  typewriter scene as the QA pass suggested — `.sec-hero { overflow: clip }` contains it in every
  phase — but the sealed receipt injecting the full token SVG (`width="400"` attributes) into
  `.sealed-token` (max-width 230px) with no svg sizing rule, inside `.sec-seal`, which has no
  overflow clip: right edge exactly 444. One-line fix in `landing.css`
  (`.sealed-token svg { width: 100%; height: auto; }`, the `.token-half svg` idiom); the token now
  renders at its container width. Verified independently in-browser this session (twice — once on
  the fix branch, once after merge): scrollWidth === clientWidth === 375 at every phase (fresh,
  writing, sealed, open overlay); six Gate-1 suites green; prose clean (same justified WARNs);
  `/spec-sync` trivial (no format-critical file touched); zero console errors; no copy changes.
  Ship: `main` fast-forwarded from `dev`, pushed; Netlify deploys `main` (unlisted).

  Century audit: n/a for a CSS-only fix touching no format/century-test row; letter-level rows
  carry unchanged from v0.3.1.

- **2026-07-11 (v0.3.0 — one front end)** — Released via `/release`. Version: minor bump to 0.3.0
  (two whole capabilities land — reminders and the unified front end — with no format-breaking
  change; the manifest `tessera` spec version stays 0.1, fixtures byte-identical). Triple moved
  together: `version.json` 0.3.0 · `LOCAL_VERSION` `'0.3.0'` (now in `js/version.js`) ·
  `CACHE_VERSION` `'tessera-v0.3.0'`. What shipped: the redesigned landing is now the whole app —
  writing at the typewriter desk, opening a received letter with ceremony (a focused overlay),
  answering it forward, keeping one for someone, and calendar/wallet-card reminders. `app.html`
  retired to a redirect; `compose.js`/`registry.js`/`main.js`/`style.css` deleted; `open.js`
  pruned to its pure verification core; `LOCAL_VERSION` relocated to `js/version.js`. Ship: `main`
  fast-forwarded from `dev`, pushed; Netlify deploys `main` (unlisted). Author approved the ship.

  Gates re-run this session, all green: Gate 1 — syntax sweep silent, six suites green
  (`test-open` passes unchanged after the prune, proving the verification core is intact),
  fixtures byte-identical. Gate 2 — prose clean but for four justified WARNs (two code-comment
  em-dashes in `print.js`/`manifest.js`; two `'—'` empty-field placeholder glyphs in the landing
  receipt preview — the documented v0.1.0 placeholders; the new `opening.js`/`reminders.js` copy
  is em-dash-free; `prose-check.js`'s default file list corrected to drop the deleted renderers
  and add the landing modules). Gate 3 — full browser walkthrough at 375px then desktop: the
  typewriter desk still writes and seals (fresh `TSR-7f69-6d8d`, `writeback` null, receipt +
  shelf + reload persistence); opening loop drop → verify (4/4 checksums, token compare) → future
  date interstitial → ceremony → letter; answer-forward launches the reply desk; a sealed reply's
  manifest + README carry the lineage and re-verify clean; custody → "in your keeping" card,
  deduped; reminders (all-dates ICS excludes open-when, includes dated custodian; wallet card
  two-up ink-light); `app.html` redirects to `/`; zero console errors; no external requests; no
  375px overflow. /spec-sync clean (no format module changed).

  Century audit (format unchanged, so letter-level rows are the same artifacts audited at v0.2.0
  this session; web-tool rows re-verified in the Gate-3 walkthrough; **physical walkthrough
  waived** — reused from v0.2, no new paper artifact, kit structure unchanged, decisions.md):

  | Row | Verdict | Evidence |
  |---|---|---|
  | A: no required URL in export | ✓ | format unchanged since v0.2.0 audit; reply README adds only the letter ID |
  | A: file:// + no external requests | ✓ | Gate-3 network log across desk-seal + opening + reminders: only same-origin, `blob:`, one inline `data:` icon — 0 external; SW registration stays `file://`-guarded |
  | A: fork = identical tool, no keys | ✓ | no package.json/build; fewer files than before (plain app deleted) |
  | A: data only on device + exports | ✓ | single `tessera_v1` key; custody stores facts-only; network log confirms nothing leaves |
  | B: UTF-8 no BOM · zip store · manifest ⊂ README (incl. writeback) · dates ISO+words · token.svg plain | ✓ | six suites green, fixtures byte-identical; no format module changed |
  | B: media guidance | n-a | no media |
  | C: spec CC0 · tool MIT · format outlives project · decisions recorded | ✓ | unchanged; decisions.md holds the unification entries |
  | D: paper completeness · cold-read · token-by-eye · checksums · assembly | ✓ (structure) | print engine + kit unchanged; physical re-walk waived (above) |
  | (note) both palettes | n-a | the app is single-palette by design now (decisions.md 2026-07-11); the lamplight dark theme lived only in the retired app.html |

- **2026-07-11 (front end unified — on dev, unreleased)** — The two-front-end split is gone: the
  redesigned landing is now the whole app, and `app.html` is a redirect to `/`. Executed
  superpowers/plans/2026-07-11-unify-front-end.md in four phases, each committed. Phase 0: relocated
  `LOCAL_VERSION` to `js/version.js`, pruned `open.js` to its pure verification core (test-open green
  unchanged, −338 lines), deleted `compose.js`/`registry.js`/`main.js`/`style.css` (−894 lines),
  redirected `app.html`, updated the SW CORE. Phase 1: `landing/opening.js`, the opening ritual as a
  focused overlay in the landing's skin (intake → verify → date gate → ceremony → reveal), reusing
  the pure `verifyLetter`; the enclosed token shown only as a `blob:` image. Phase 2: "Answer it
  forward." (`TesseraLanding.answerForward` → the desk carries `writeback` into the seal → manifest +
  README lineage) and custody intake ("I am keeping this for someone" → an "in your keeping" shelf
  card, deduped, shelf refreshed via `TesseraLanding.refreshShelf`). Phase 3: `landing/reminders.js`
  — "Add to calendar" on the sealed receipt and a shelf-level "Calendar file (all dates)" + "Print a
  wallet card" (the decorative shelf stays uncluttered; decisions.md). Gates: six suites green,
  fixtures byte-identical, prose clean; browser-verified per phase (opening loop, write-back reply
  re-verifies clean, custody, reminders, reduced motion, no console errors, no external requests).
  No format change (`tessera` stays 0.1). Decisions + architecture + opening docs updated. Awaits
  `/release` as **v0.3.0** (reminders + the unified front end shipping together); the versioning
  triple and SW CORE move at release.

- **2026-07-10 (v0.2 reminders — on dev, unreleased)** — plans/v0.2-reminders.md landed, all three
  tasks. Task 1: `js/ics.js`, a pure/deterministic RFC 5545 builder (dual-env, no Date.now — the
  DTSTAMP is the letter's `written` date) with `tools/test-ics.js` (13 asserts: envelope, all-day
  DTSTART, DTSTAMP, 75-octet folding by code point, §3.3.11 escaping, multi-letter calendars,
  optional VALARM, determinism) and a born fixture `reminder-fix1.ics` asserted byte-identical.
  Gate-1 suite list in CLAUDE.md + testing.md corrected to name all six suites (`test-open` had
  drifted off). Task 2: wired into the sealed screen, every registry row (waiting + in-keeping),
  and a whole-registry "Calendar file (all dates)" — open-when letters are never offered a
  calendar file (no date to remember); `export.js` grew a generic `downloadText`. Task 3: the
  open-dates card, a `print.js` register variant (`sheet-card`) — the same wallet/drawer card
  twice on one A4 split by a dashed cut line, listing ID · opens · for, self-identifying; reached
  by "Print a wallet card" in the ledger. Browser-verified: ICS builder output correct, button
  gating right across all surfaces, card renders two copies with the dashed cut and is ink-light
  (paper cream sheet, transparent cards, zero dark solid fills), zero console errors, no external
  requests. Six suites green; prose WARNs are all code-comment em-dashes (house convention).
  Commits `c9871fd` (builder), `2fb9d2e` (wiring), Task 3 following. Not yet released — waits for
  the next `/release` (the triple stays at 0.2.0; `js/ics.js` is in the SW CORE but CACHE_VERSION
  moves only via /release). Remaining manual check deferred to the author: import an exported
  `.ics` into two calendar apps (Google + Outlook) to confirm the all-day event lands on the day.

- **2026-07-10 (v0.2.0 — the opening ships)** — Released via `/release`. Version: minor bump to
  0.2.0 (a whole new capability, the opening, with no format-breaking change — the manifest
  `tessera` spec version stays 0.1; the reserved `writeback` field simply came alive and the
  README gained a conditional, additive lineage line). Triple moved together: `version.json`
  0.2.0 · `LOCAL_VERSION` `'0.2.0'` · `CACHE_VERSION` `'tessera-v0.2.0'`. What shipped: the fourth
  door — a store-method zip reader, verification core (checksums + token re-derivation + README
  fallback), the date interstitial, the ceremony (paper-first offer, chrome quiets, facts held a
  breath, letter fades in; reduced-motion collapses), "Answer it forward." write-back carrying
  `{inReplyTo, generation}` into the sealed manifest and README, and custody intake (facts-only
  `role: "custodian"` entries, storage schema 3). Ship: `main` fast-forwarded from `dev`, pushed;
  Netlify deploys `main` at tessera-letters.netlify.app (unlisted).

  Gates re-run this session, all green: Gate 1 — syntax sweep over every tracked JS silent, five
  module suites green (`test-manifest` with new writeback/lineage asserts, `test-zip`,
  `test-token`, `test-state` at schema 3, `test-open` with writeback round-trip), fixtures
  byte-identical. Gate 2 — prose clean. Gate 3 — full browser walkthrough 375px-first then
  desktop: real wizard seal (auto-download, registry row persists reload), print overlay, opening
  door across clean/tamper/early-open, ceremony + reduced-motion, both themes, no overflow, zero
  console errors, SW re-registered (26 precached entries). /spec-sync clean after the
  readme-template lineage addition.

  Century audit (all rows evidenced this session; **physical walkthrough waived** — author-
  accepted, decisions.md 2026-07-10: kit structurally identical to the v0.1.0 walkthrough, sole
  new paper element is the wrap-tested lineage line):

  | Row | Verdict | Evidence |
  |---|---|---|
  | A: no required URL in export | ✓ | reply README adds only the letter ID; "web addresses die, none required" intact |
  | A: file:// + no external requests | ✓ | network log across open→verify→ceremony→answer→reply-seal: only same-origin, `blob:`, one inline `data:` icon — 0 external |
  | A: fork = identical tool, no keys | ✓ | no package.json/build; opening feature pure vanilla |
  | A: data only on device + exports | ✓ | custody intake stores facts-only locally; network log confirms nothing leaves |
  | B: UTF-8, no BOM | ✓ | node hex check on all five files of a real reply |
  | B: zip store method | ✓ | reply letter text found raw in zip bytes; suite green |
  | B: manifest ⊂ README prose (incl. writeback) | ✓ | node: all seven facts incl. lineage in prose; originating letter emits none |
  | B: dates ISO + words | ✓ | "the twenty-first of June, two thousand and forty-four (2044-06-21)" |
  | B: media guidance | n-a | no media in v0.2 |
  | B: token.svg plain, no scripts/refs/fonts | ✓ | only `xmlns` namespace + internal `url(#cut-*)`; token.js untouched |
  | C: spec CC0 · tool MIT · format outlives project · decisions recorded | ✓ | headers unchanged; decisions.md has the three v0.2 entries + the waiver |
  | D: paper completeness · cold-read · token-by-eye · checksums · assembly | ✓ (structure) | kit structurally identical to the v0.1.0 physical walkthrough; physical re-walk waived (above) |

- **2026-07-10 (v0.2 write-back + custody intake)** — Task 5 of plans/v0.2-opening.md landed,
  closing the plan's implementation tasks. Write-back: "Answer it forward." after the ceremony
  hands `{inReplyTo, generation}` to compose (new `TesseraCompose.answerForward`; attach-never-
  discard if a draft exists — decisions.md), the draft carries it through reload, and
  `doSeal → export.seal → buildManifest` threads it into the sealed manifest. The README grows a
  conditional lineage line ("In answer to: …") because the manifest may never say what the README
  doesn't — an additive format event, recorded in decisions.md + readme-template.md; fixtures
  byte-identical, manifest `tessera` stays 0.1. Custody intake: "I am keeping this for someone"
  on the verify screen records facts-only `role: "custodian"` entries (schema 3 via
  `state.migrate()`, everything older backfills `role: "writer"`); the shelf gains "In your
  keeping". Browser QA at 375px with a synthetic letter: custody intake → confirmation → shelf
  row → reload persists → dedupe ("It is already in your keeping."); full reply loop: open →
  ceremony → Answer it forward → draft carries generation 1 → sealed as a real zip whose manifest
  and README both speak the lineage — and which re-verifies clean through the opening door with
  `facts.writeback` intact (generation 2 would follow). Zero console errors, no overflow. Gate 1
  green (five suites; new writeback/schema-3/lineage tests), prose clean, /spec-sync clean after
  the template fix. Full /qa closed the task same day: Gate-3 walkthrough at 375px then desktop —
  real wizard seal (TSR-1d81-9584, auto-download, registry row persists reload), print overlay
  (cover + instructions sheets, footers), tamper flow (letter.txt "does not match" with the
  cascade of warnings, reading still allowed, edited P.S. visible), early-open interstitial with
  the exact canon copy and once-per-session gating, reduced-motion collapse, both themes
  (lamplight rgb(28,24,19) / paper rgb(247,243,234)), no overflow either size, zero console
  errors, SW re-registered with 26 precached entries, screenshots captured.

- **2026-07-10 (v0.2 ceremony)** — Task 4 of plans/v0.2-opening.md landed (`5f827d2`): the reveal
  offers paper first ("Read it on paper instead" → shared print-kit preview, always the re-drawn
  token, never the enclosed SVG — decision recorded in decisions.md), and reading here quiets the
  chrome, holds the facts ~2s, and fades into the letter. Browser QA with a synthetic letter
  (TSR-ce0a-e4d4, built from the real format helpers, deleted after): intake → verify (4/4
  checksums, facts from manifest) → reveal → ceremony end-to-end; reduced-motion collapses
  straight to the text (no intro, no animation class); leaving mid-ceremony by nav restores the
  chrome instantly and the guarded timers never render the letter over the next screen; Done →
  chrome back, `#home`; paper path renders all four sheets with the re-drawn token and Back
  returns to the reveal; zero console errors; 375px clean (no horizontal overflow). Gate 1 green
  (all five suites incl. test-open), prose clean. QA note for next time: the driver must route
  through another hash between `#open` runs — navigating `#open`→`#open` fires no hashchange
  (this, not an app bug, was the prior session's "flow stops" symptom).

- **2026-07-10 (v0.1.0 — first ship)** — Released via `/release`. Version: the triple already
  read `0.1.0` / `'0.1.0'` / `'tessera-v0.1.0'` consistently and nothing had ever shipped, so
  0.1.0 ships as-is (a bump would misstate the first release). What shipped: the whole of v0.1 —
  the landing as the real front door (ceremony sealing through the one `export.js` path), the
  quiet app at `app.html`, print kit with the landing faces, schema-2 storage, offline shell,
  five founding letters sealed in the author's keeping. Ship: `main` minted from `dev`
  (fast-forward), pushed; Netlify serves it unlisted at tessera-letters.netlify.app.
  Gates re-run this session, all green: syntax sweep over every tracked JS silent; four module
  suites green with fixtures byte-identical; prose clean; browser pass 375px-first then desktop
  (front-door seal `TSR-2641-af4b` end-to-end: wizard → typed letter → real zip download with
  independently re-verified SHA-256 checksums → registry row (schema 2, sealKey) → reload
  persists → both-door visibility → ceremony print kit as real A4 + Letter PDFs, 4 sheets,
  footers, assembly line on the cover, faces per canon with the letter body on the system stack
  per the same-day specimen verdict); offline via SW cache (43 entries) with both doors and the
  writing room working; lamplight palette exact under emulated dark; reduced-motion gate present.
  Known-and-accepted: repeated AudioContext autoplay warnings under automation (sound starts on
  first real user gesture; zero console errors otherwise).

- **2026-07-10 (author paper tasks clear)** — The three remaining author tasks landed in one
  sitting: specimen verdict is B (letter body stays on the system serif stack; no CSS change,
  `specimen.html` deleted, canon updated in design-language.md §Typography); founding letters
  settled (v0.1 ships with the five already sealed in `letters/` — four by Claude, one by the
  author; see decisions.md); the amended cover-sheet line re-read on paper against the
  century-test protocol and passed. v0.1 now waits only on the Netlify site setup (author
  account) and `/release`.

- **2026-07-10 (landing goes real)** — The front door is the landing and the ceremony is real:
  sealNow() ends in TesseraExport.seal() → registry → download (random-seed souvenir deleted),
  shelf reads tessera_v1 (demo letters retired — their IDs collided with the founding letters'),
  print engine shared via print.css so the kit prints at the ceremony, index.html→app.html +
  landing.html→index.html, fonts consolidated to fonts/, storage schema 2 (sealKey) via migrate()
  with tools/test-state.js as the fourth Gate-1 suite. Browser-verified end-to-end on both doors
  (front-door seal → entry visible in app.html#letters → reload persists; 22-entry precache;
  zero console errors; 375px clean). Author cleared the image licensing gate the same day, so
  this ships with v0.1 via /release. Spec: superpowers/specs/2026-07-10-landing-goes-real-design.md.

- **2026-07-10 (print base look)** — Print kit typography aligned with the landing:
  `fonts/` vendors Young Serif + Courier Prime (OFL), style.css maps display/typewriter
  faces onto the existing sheet classes with system-stack fallbacks, sw.js precaches the
  TTFs (CACHE_VERSION untouched). Letter body awaits the specimen print (author, paper;
  `specimen.html`, temporary). Gates green (module suites, prose clean, browser pass at
  375px + desktop, fonts in SW cache, no external requests); /spec-sync clean. Spec:
  superpowers/specs/2026-07-10-print-base-look-design.md.

- **2026-07-10 (physical walkthrough)** — First physical century walkthrough (author, real printer). Finding: the kit never said the cover sheet faces out — following the protocol sealed the instructions page inside and left the envelope blank. Fixed same day: assembly line on the cover sheet (print.js), century-test.md steps 2/4 amended + new assembly D-check, print-kit.md and testing.md aligned, decisions.md entry. Author reports the remaining walkthrough steps passed (text-editor reopen, cold read of the instructions page).

- **2026-07-10 (late night, second pass)** — Author-requested mobile/UX polish on the landing plus responsive background overhaul: all three floral sections now select author-generated art compositions per screen shape (media queries, JPEG q88, assets 7.9→4.4 MB); on phones the wizard is a centered dialog over a scrim, the letters shelf is a swipeable snap rail, and touch targets / focus-visible rings / 16px mobile inputs / reduced-motion-gated reveals landed page-wide. Found and fixed en route: a `justify-content` axis flip that pushed the scene over the hero copy in column layout, and a genuine 77px horizontal overflow at 375px (gone with the rail). Desktop unchanged; gates green.

- **2026-07-10 (late night)** — Landing page implemented from the author's Claude Design project ("Tessera landing implementation", handoff bundle verified byte-identical to the live design). New surface: `landing.html` + `landing/` (css, js, 17 images, vendored OFL fonts for Young Serif + Courier Prime). Vanilla port of the full prototype: CSS-drawn typewriter with working carriage/caret/type-bar, synthesized Web Audio (clack/bell/zip, toggleable), auto-typing intro demo, setup wizard, seal step with 12-seal picker, receipt preview, ceremonial sealing that mints a real `token.js` token, three-presentation letters shelf. Reuses `data/occasions.js` and `js/token.js` unchanged; app shell and versioning triple untouched. Gates: syntax + all module tests green, prose-check clean apart from two justified placeholder-glyph WARNs (decisions.md), browser QA at desktop + 375px with zero console errors. Author gate added: confirm background/wax-seal image licensing before the landing ships publicly.

- **2026-07-10 (night)** — First real use of the writing room (two letters sealed through the app: TSR-471a-31bf, TSR-1e9e-906d) immediately surfaced a bug: the autosave debounce could re-persist a just-sealed draft after `clearDraft`, so re-entering `#write` resumed an already-sealed letter at the review step. Fixed in `doSeal` (cancel timer, drop live draft) and verified in-browser: post-seal `#write` starts at "1 of 6". `letters/` added to .gitignore so personal sealed folders never ship with a public repo. Bonus finding: `datesInWords` renders 2126 correctly.

- **2026-07-10 (evening)** — Executed plans/v0.1-completion.md Tasks 1–6. Shell landed; full browser QA: compose→seal loop produced folder `TSR-17ee-5e98` with all five spec files, checksums re-verified with Get-FileHash, print engine proven via A4 + Letter PDFs, offline pass green (14 precached entries), lamplight + paper themes screenshotted, 375px first. prose-check caught and fixed two real em-dash UI strings. Known dev-only friction: the service worker's cache-first strategy serves stale files during development; unregister the SW (or bump CACHE_VERSION) after editing shell files. Remaining: Task 7 (author).
- **2026-07-10** — Session: code audit (modules ~90%, all tests green, shell missing); wrote CLAUDE.md, six project skills, dev server, this tracker, and plans for v0.1 completion + full v0.2. Cost review: stack is $0 end-to-end on free tiers; only future watch-item is Netlify Forms at v1.0 (free-tier cap; zero-cost swap noted in plans/later-versions.md).
